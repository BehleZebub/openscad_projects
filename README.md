# openscad_projects
This is a collection of some of my openscad projects.

I upload them not to share them with you but to keep track of changes and there may be files that are dirty and do not follow best practice rules.
You have been warned.

## portapack_case
It's a case for the hackrf portapack h2. It allows the device to stand upright which normally doesn't work since there are sma connectors at the bottom for CLK. It also prevents fall damage to the housing.

## soap_holder
It'sa holder for hard soap that prevents soaking
